```rust
i8, i16, i32, i64, i128
u8, u16, u32, u64, u128

f32, f64

bool, bit

char
```

### Efficient size
`i32` uses all its space to store data.

`bool` uses only 1 bit of it's `8-bit` implementation, so it's efficient size is 1 bit.

Efficient size could be used as memory usage optimization in bitfields, enum arrays, unions.

### Additional efficient types
`i63` uses 63 bits of it's `64-bit` implementation. `1` bit could be used as some kind of marker.

`Option<i63>` could use `64-bits` (the same as `i64`)
